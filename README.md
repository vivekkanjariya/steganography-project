This project uses blockchain technology to securely store the hash of images containing hidden documents via steganography. Each document’s proof of existence and integrity is stored in an immutable blockchain, ensuring tamper-proof provenance. Blockchain enables secure tracking and verification of document authenticity over time.

This project requires a PNG image as input to hide or extract the secret message. given example img1.png and img2.png
